											<li>We all know that the Natural Resources are not evenly distributed across our geography. Due to this some countries rich in resources have rapidly developed and some countries not so rich are not so developed or are still underdeveloped.This basic difference necessitates the exchange of goods and services across the boundaries of each others.</li>
											<li>From the perspective of any one country if any goods and services enter their territory through various modes viz foreign Land, Air and Ocean crossing the international borders of other countries then such entry is called Import for that country. Accordingly if any indigenously made goods and services goes out of their territory passing through their Land borders, Air and Territorial Water then such movement is called Export for that country.</li>		
											<li>To balance such in and out movements keeping the best interest of their land every country has formed its own Trade Control Regulations which are enforced by Customs of the respective countries. This is how a country ensure smooth flow of the permitted International Trade i.e. Import & Export of commodities and services between other countries and home after complying all their specified procedures, paying necessary duties and taxes.</li>		
											<li>To further ease this process and to have common customs rules across Globe, on the principles of GAAT – the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, WCO – the World Customs Organisation has made all countries a confirming member including India.</li>		
											<li>A local person or group of people who understands and having complete knowledge of all these Trade Regulations of their country, having been authorized by their Customs Department is called a Customs Broker.</li>		
											<li>An ideal Customs Broker is one who has kept themselves abreast with all the Trade Regulations, having the best infrastructure and manpower to help their client in meeting all the necessary Customs Clearance Procedures Swiftly and Deliver the client’s cargo in timely manner without incurring any Detentions and Demurrages. </li>		
											<li>Hence Customs Brokerage is been envisaged as a very highly specialized profession.</li>		
											<li>Being a developing country in India too there are too many Trade Rules & Regulations to be complied in International Trade. To be capable of all this as per our Customs Rules and Regulations every Broker need to undergo a qualifying examination and comply with various control measures periodically, undergo regular updation of the new notification / procedures and then only an individual or a firm shall be issued a work permit to operate as a Customs Authorized Broker in the country.</li>		
											<li>Furthermore a Broker / Service Provider when complied with all the norms of our Indian Customs then such Broker / Service Provider is awarded with AEO LO status – which means said broker is reliable in terms of their service.</li>	
											<li>As a ‘Customs Authorized Broker’ here we “STAR GROUP” readily come to your help. Being a leading Broker we are operating under our own License No. 11/976 since last two decades. </li>	
											<li>Since we are a compliant organization we have also applied for AEO LO status and the same is expected anytime in the near future. During this long journey our core TEAM has amassed rich and satisfactory field experience in almost all type of customs transactions.</li>	
											<li>At present we have a large team of professionals and ensured that they too are having hands on expertise about all types of activities sited below.</li>
